## Animal Care

Animal care was chosen as the app topic for its universal relevance and the growing interest in responsible pet ownership. With many people considering pets as part of their families, there is a strong need for accessible education on how to properly care for them. By focusing on this topic, the app aims to raise awareness, promote empathy, and provide practical knowledge, helping users understand the responsibilities involved in looking after animals while fostering a sense of compassion and care for living creatures.

## Why Play PetSimulatAR?

PetSimulatAR offers a fun and interactive way for users to explore the responsibilities of pet care through augmented reality. By immersing players in a realistic simulation, the game teaches essential pet needs such as feeding, grooming, exercise, and health management, all while providing an engaging, hands-on experience. Users can develop a deeper understanding of animal care, fostering empathy and responsibility, whether they’re aspiring pet owners or simply interested in learning more. With AR technology bringing virtual pets to life in the real world, PetSimulatAR creates an exciting, educational opportunity to practice and refine pet care skills in a dynamic, lifelike environment.
